		<h2>Judo waza (techniques)</h2>
		<h5>List of judo techniques and List of Kodokan judo techniques</h5>
		<p>There are three basic categories of waza (技, techniques) in judo:</p> 
		<ul>
			<li>nage-waza (投げ技, throwing techniques),</li> 
			<li>katame-waza (固技, grappling techniques) and </li> 
			<li>atemi-waza (当て身技, striking techniques).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Judo is most known for nage-waza and katame-waza.</p>

		<p>Judo practitioners typically devote a portion of each practice session to <strong>ukemi (受け身, break-falls)</strong>, in order that nage-waza can be practiced without significant risk of injury. Several distinct types of ukemi exist, including 
			<ol><strong>
				<li>ushiro ukemi (後ろ受身, rear breakfalls),</li>
				<li>yoko ukemi (横受け身, side breakfalls),</li>
				<li>mae ukemi (前受け身, front breakfalls) and</li>
				<li>zenpo kaiten ukemi (前方回転受身, rolling breakfalls)</li></strong>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>The person who performs a Waza is known as <strong>tori (取り, literally "taker")</strong> and the person to whom it is performed is known as <strong>uke (受け, "receiver").</strong></p><br><hr>

		<h3>Nage waza (throwing techniques)</h3>
		<p>Nage waza include all techniques in which tori attempts to throw or trip uke, usually with the aim of placing uke on his back. Each technique has three distinct stages:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Kuzushi (崩し), the initial balance break;</li>
			<li>Tsukuri (作り), the act of turning in and fitting into the throw;</li>
			<li>Kake (掛け), the execution and completion of the throw.</li>
			<li>Before an effective kuzushi can be performed, it is important to establish a firm grip (組み方, kumi kata).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Nage waza are typically drilled by the use of uchi komi (内込), repeated turning-in, taking the throw up to the point of kake.</p>

		<p>Traditionally, nage waza are further categorised into</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>tachi-waza (立ち技, standing techniques)</strong>, throws that are performed with tori maintaining an upright position, and</li>
			<li><strong>sutemi-waza (捨身技, sacrifice techniques)</strong>, throws in which tori sacrifices his upright position in order to throw uke.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Tachi-waza are further subdivided into:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>te-waza (手技, hand techniques)</strong>, in which tori predominantly uses his arms to throw uke,</li>
			<li><strong>koshi-waza (腰技, hip techniques)</strong> throws that predominantly use a lifting motion from the hips and</li>
			<li><strong>ashi-waza (足技, foot and leg techniques)</strong>, throws in which tori predominantly utilises his legs.</li>
		</ul>


		<h5>Over View of Nage-waza</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>Tachi-waza (立ち技) -- standing techniques</li>
			<li>Te-waza (手技) -- hand techniques</li>
			<li>Koshi-waza (腰技) -- hip techniques</li>
			<li>Ashi-waza (足技) -- foot and leg techniques</li>
			<li>Sutemi-waza (捨身技) -- sacrifice techniques</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Ma-sutemi-waza (真捨身技) -- rear sacrifice techniques</li>
					<li>Yoko-sutemi-waza (橫捨身技) -- side sacrifice techniques</li>
				</ul>
		</ol><br><hr>


		<h3>Katame-waza (grappling techniques)</h3>
		<p>Katame-waza is further categorised into osaekomi-waza (押込技, holding techniques), in which tori traps and pins uke on his back on the floor; shime-waza (絞技, strangulation techniques), in which tori attempts to force a submission by choking or strangling uke; and kansetsu-waza (関節技, joint techniques), in which tori attempts to submit uke by painful manipulation of his joints.</p>

		<p>A related concept is that of ne-waza (寝技, prone techniques), in which waza are applied from a non-standing position.</p>

		<p>In competitive judo, Kansetsu-waza is currently limited to elbow joint manipulation. Manipulation and locking of other joints can be found in various kata, such as Katame-no-kata and Kodokan goshin jutsu.</p>

		<h5>Over View of Katame-Waza </h5>
		<ol>
			<li>Juji gatame (十字固, cross lock)(armbar), a kansetsu-waza</li>
			<li>Katame-waza (固技) -- grappling techniques</li>
			<li>Osaekomi-waza (押込技) -- holding or pinning techniques</li>
			<li>Shime-waza (絞技) -- strangulation techniques</li>
			<li>Kansetsu-waza (関節技) -- Joint techniques (locks)</li>
		</ol><br><hr>


		<h3>Atemi-waza (striking techniques)</h3>
		<p>Atemi-waza are techniques in which tori disables uke with a strike to a vital point. Atemi-waza are not permitted outside of kata.</p><br><hr>


		<h3>Randori (free practice)</h3>
		<p>Judo pedagogy emphasizes randori (乱取り, literally "taking chaos", but meaning "free practice"). This term covers a variety of forms of practice, and the intensity at which it is carried out varies depending on intent and the level of expertise of the participants. At one extreme, is a compliant style of randori, known as Yakusoku geiko (約束稽古, prearranged practice), in which neither participant offers resistance to their partner's attempts to throw. A related concept is that of Sute geiko (捨稽古, throw-away practice), in which an experienced judoka allows himself to be thrown by his less-experienced partner.[34] At the opposite extreme from yakusoku geiko is the hard style of randori that seeks to emulate the style of judo seen in competition. While hard randori is the cornerstone of judo, over-emphasis of the competitive aspect is seen as undesirable by traditionalists if the intent of the randori is to "win" rather than to learn</p><br><hr>


		<h3>Kansetsu and shime waza</h3>
		<p>The application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo dojo and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.</p><br><hr>
